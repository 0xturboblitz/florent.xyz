I founded OpenPassport, a passport proving protocol using zk-SNARKs which [joined Self Protocol in February](https://self.xyz/blog/prove-your-self-launch-press-release).

I'm now contributing to Self Protocol and learning ML interpretability.

I love math, computer science and technology. Previously, I ran a [french youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@FlorentTavernier) and founded a [sculpture atelier](https://x.com/AtelierMissor_).
